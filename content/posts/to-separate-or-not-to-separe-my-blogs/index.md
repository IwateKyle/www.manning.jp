## In the near past

I've gone back and forth with the pains of simply making decisions on what technology to use for getting my site(s) running and now that I'm here - (there?) - However I find my self trying to answer a new set of questions.

## What _is_ the purpose of a website _?_

...or blog in this case.

I won't say that the thoughts of internet commerce don't cross my mind, but at this point I don't have an online business

I just want my own website, because it's cool - and cheap - and, and, and ...

However, I have so much that I want to say. At least I think I do at times. When it comes right down to it, I find that I have so many interests that I don't say anything about anything.

Even this blog post right now is just me spinning my wheels.

Part of the purpose of this post is to break up with you before we have had our first kiss. Awww ~ that sucks.

But don't worry, I'll let you know where you can find me.

## Multiple Disparate Topics

With the myriad of topics that I like to talk about which include

- technology

- Programming
  - GoLang
  - JavaScript
  - Front End Web Development
  - Back End Web development
- Blender 3D
  - modeling
  - rigging
  - UV manipulation
  - Rendering
  - Animation
- Software in General

- Health

  - diet
  - tools
    - Vitamix

- business

**The list goes ON** I could ramble on and on about so many things. So I'm leaning toward splitting up my blogs / sites into multi-domain sites. On the other hand I'm still not sure.

This blog is acting as a counseling session for me right now.

## Divide and Conquer

I'm looking at dividing my topics up into distinct sites (blogs) to best cover these various categories.

Topics that will stay on this site would be

- lifestyle
- Japan related stuff
- diet and health ramblings
- maybe some general techie stuff.

Other spin off sites would cover my techno-geek talk stuff. These would include the topics and more that I listed earlier in the tech stuff. I'm not

*.TLD (Top Level Domains)
I'm not thinking necessarily about purchasing new TLDs. I'll probably just create some subdomains off of my current manning.jp domain to be something like *technology.manning.jp*, or *blender.manning.jp\*, etc,. It just depends on how much I imagine I'll have to say or desire to say about each unique category.

Blender is my favorite topic right now, so out of the gate, I'll probably be thinking about cornering that topic into it's own site. Let's see!

## Unresolved

Well, anyway at this point, it's still up-in-the-air about how I will go about this. Please wait in front of your computer for another post.
