# This really is my first post

- just changed it to page bundle -

Yes, this really is my first post. In a long time. I struggle for months on different decisions such as

- What provider should I use ?
- What blogging / site technology should I use?
- Should I use a static site technology or dynamic?
- What programming language should I use for the backend? (Python, NodeJs, GoLang, etc. )

I'll keep this post short for now. Expect more in the future.
